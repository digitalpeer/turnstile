JdhSocket Library - Portable, Thread Safe Sockets Library

Please see the COPYING file for copyright information.

* This is a wrapper to the basic c socket functions as well as extra
	functionality, error detection, and may be used in a
	multithreaded environment.
* Many of the base c function calls share memory.  This aims to make
	those calls thread safe.
* The library has only been tested with Linux and Win32.
* The thread safe capabilities use the wxWidgets library.  Maybe in
	the future I'll use the pthreads library.  I just have no
	burning need to use them.
